The most important thing that my posterity should know is that I am totally and completely in love with Mary Jane Wilkes. She is fantastic. 

I doubt any of my family will read this before they actually know (and it is official), but I will be marrying her. 

She is the most amazing woman I've ever met. 

I should probably stop writing, because I could write entire books about her character. She is the most virtuous woman I've ever met in my entire life, and her Faith and Charity is next to none.
