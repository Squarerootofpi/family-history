I had a very interesting conversation with my immediate family last week (minus Aaron) about gossiping as a part of the Come Follow Me. We discussed Doctrine and Covenants 42:27 "Thou shalt not aspeak evil of thy neighbor, nor do him any harm."

There are several people in the immediate family and of recently passed away ancestors that were brought up in this discussion. My Great Grandma Carol Olsen was one of the people mentioned by my Dad David Steed Jr. He said that she never, ever, would say anything bad about anyone, but would just quietly listen when people vented or talked ill of others. 

We also noted that Grandma and Grandpa Huber (My Mom's Parents) were both exceptional at this. I recall stories of how my Grandpa Huber (Leon) was incredibly loving, even those who were easily judged by others. This actually helped me judge people less, and I have tried to apply my understanding of their example in how I look at girls and guys within my apartment complex at Campus Plaza and BYU. I believe it's helped me have much more understanding and charity.
